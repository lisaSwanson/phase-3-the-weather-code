# phase-3-the-weather-code

The challenge was to delv into a new technology not taught at DevBootCamp. The new technology I chose was to learn Swift 2. Swift 2 is a hybrid between a compiled high level language and a scripting language, as it is explained in several blogs. The hybrid portion is the ability to use a "playground" to see results of your code before you run/complile it thus allowing for "swifter" implementation of projects.

I have written two apps:

1) To Do App 2) What is The Weather?

These projects are for review only and while they are "open source" I don't consider them to be anything that someone would want to fork or clone so I won't be leaving instructions on "how to contribute". :)
